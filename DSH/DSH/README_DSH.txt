%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 
% Example usage:
% 1. Modify "Makefile.config" according to your system, and follow the 
%    instructions on "http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html"
%    to compile the source code.
% 2. Run "data/cifar10/get_cifar10.sh" to download the data of CIFAR-10.
% 3. Run "CIFAR-10/create_cifar10.sh" to convert the data of CIFAR-10
%    to LMDB format.
% 4. Run "CIFAR-10/train_full.sh" to train an example model.
% 5. Run "CIFAR-10/finetune.sh" to finetune an existing model 
%    for different code length.
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 
% Tips:
% 1. We have provided a tool for extracting network activations, you may
%    refer to "CIFAR-10/extract_code.sh" for example usage. The example 
%    code extracts the real-valued network outputs, and writes them into a 
%    binary file. The first 12 floating point numbers correspond to the
%    first image, and the second 12 correspond to the second image, and 
%    so on.
% 2. We have also provided a "HashingImageData" layer which corresponds to 
%    the online image pair generation scheme described in our paper. This 
%    scheme is extremely useful for large scale dataset, where dissimilar
%    pairs outnumber similar pairs. Please refer to 
%    "CIFAR-10/train_test.prototxt" for example usage.
% 3. Our code was modified to support multi-label images as in NUS-WIDE, 
%    please refer to "NUS/train.txt", "NUS/test.txt", "NUS/create_NUS.sh"
%    for example usages.
